# Todo-MVP

The objective of this project is to demonstrate that it is _relatively_ simple
to build web applications using HTML, CSS and a small amount of server side
code written in a language of your choice.

Whereas I respect the skill and effort that has been put into developing client
side browser applications in JavaScript, it's my contention that a good deal of
that functionality can be achieved by the correct application of the tried and
tested technologies of HTML and CSS, especially in the modern versions, [CSS
3][CSS3] and [HTML 5][HTML5].

I also like many of the server side frameworks that are used to write web
applications in - Ruby on Rails, Spring, Django for example. But I also believe
that for many of the simple (and not so simple) applications that we build on
the Web we do not need them.

That is to say that, while I think these frameworks have their place, they are
for the most part both cumbersome and obfuscating, and no better than using
simpler libraries and technologies.

The subject of this demonstration is the (increasingly hackneyed) Todo app,
implemented in a server side language and presented in HTML and CSS.

## What this is not

This is not a Luddite call to smash the frames and go back to hand weaving the
Web. That would be stupid. Rather, the idea is to keep it simple; the simplest
possible solution to writing a Todo application isn't written in the front end

## The Todo Application

## The HTML

## The CSS

## Acceptance Testing

## Prior Art

This started with an [angry blog post on Dev.To]

This project takes its sublect matter from [TodoMVC][TodoMVC], a project which
shows off how to build a simple Todo application using client side technologies
(such as AngularJS, React and Vue.js).

It was inspired by:
  - Adrian Holovaty's dotJS talk [A Framework Author's Case Against Frameworks][Holovaty]
  - Chris James's [The Web I Want][CJWeb]

It is nothing to do with the Android architecture MVP.

> It is up to developers to make their sites work (or at least fallback gracefully) whether JavaScript is or isn't available. The reason for JavaScript being unavailable, whether it's user choice, network conditions or browser interventions, is unimportant. Building a resilient experience is the only way we can serve our users best.
